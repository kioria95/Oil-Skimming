# Oil-Skimming
This is the code that I wrote when I was undertaking my final year project back at University. It is written in C++ in the Arduino IDE. It enables the user to connect to the robot
via Bluetooth and the user is able to send various commands to the robot to do the following:
-Move forward
-Move backwards
-Initiate Oil skimming
-Turn left
-Turn right
The user is also able to see the Oil level amount that is relayed over the bluetooth serial communication.
